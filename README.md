# Web-Scraper-using-Python
In this project, I build my own web scraper with Python that pulls all the stories from Google News by extracting all the tags from the HTML of Google News.
Now with this web scraper with Python, you can collect Google News headlines, the possibilities are endless. You can write a program to analyze the most used words in headlines.
